          <h1> Title One</h1>
          <p> 'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.' 'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.' 'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.' 'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. 'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.' 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice. 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' </p>

          <h1> Title Two</h1>
          <p> 'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.' 'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice. 'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.' This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?' 'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle. 'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly. 'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: 'tell her something about the games now.  </p>

        </article>
        <article>
          <h1> Title Three</h1>
          <p> At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:â€” 'You may not have lived much under the seaâ€”' ('I haven't,' said Alice)â€”'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterâ€”' (Alice began to say 'I once tastedâ€”' but checked herself hastily, and said 'No, never') '  </p>

        </article>
        <article>
          <h1> Title Four</h1>
          <p> â€”so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' 'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?' 'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the sea-shoreâ€”' 'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayâ€”' 'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon. 'â€”you advance twiceâ€”' 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon. 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partnersâ€”' 'â€”change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon. </p>

        </article>
         <article>
          <h1> Title Five</h1>
          <p> 'I've forgotten the words.' So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:â€” '"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail. "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles  </p>

          <h1> Title Six</h1>
          <p> 'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon. 'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partnersâ€”' 'â€”change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon. 'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw theâ€”' 'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. 'â€”as far out to sea as you canâ€”' 'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon. 'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly </p>
